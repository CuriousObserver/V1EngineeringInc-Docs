    + ESP32-wroom-32 Based control board
        * 32bit dual-core 240mhz board.
        * WiFi, USB Direct connection, or Bluetooth (rarely used).
        * Can have Onboard or external antenna
        * Micro USB, or USB-C
        * Socket based for easy swapping if anything were to ever go wrong, or you want to quickly change configs.
        * 38 pin - [ESP32-DevKitC CP2102 - MicroUSB](https://amzn.to/4766q7B), These seem to be the most reliable.
        * 25.4mm header width
    
    + 9-24VDC
        * Current required is a minimum of 19W (24Vx0.8A).
        * If you plan on using the high current outputs adjust accordingly.

    + 6x Stepper driver sockets
        * This controller is designed for use with TMC2209 drivers in UART control mode only
        * Typically, TMC2209 drivers are limited to 4 addresses. This controller uses a CS (chip select) pin for 3 of the drivers to allow 6 drivers to be individually controlled.
        * The sockets are labeled XYZABC, but you can use any socket for any axis or motor number. The letters are just for reference only.
        * **No Stallguard**

    + 7x Inputs
        * All switch inputs are active low, the LED goes on when ground is connected to the pin.
        * They have a 10k pullup external to the ESP32. The signal pin (S) should be connected to the ground pin (G) to activate the switch. 
        * The 5V Rail is optional and is used for external switches that require 5V. 
        * The input pins can be pins in the config file to use Normally Open or Normally Closed inputs.

    + 2x Line level outputs (same as input voltage)
        * PWM Capable
        * The MOSFETs switch to ground. You can use any voltage up to the VMot max as the positive, as long as it uses the same ground reference.
        * Can be used to drive 2.5A continuously before they overheat. You can use them intermittently up to 3.5A.
        * They can be used with inductive loads (solenoids, relays, DC fans/motors)

    + 2x 5V outputs
        * PWM Capable
        * These will source and sink about 25mA each.
        * Most commonly used for tool SSR's and Lasers.
        * See the "Spindle" section of the FluidNC wiki for common uses.

    + 1x Expansion Module socket
        * [6 PACK expansion module source](https://oshwlab.com/bdring?tab=project&page=1)
        * [Buy Them](https://www.tindie.com/stores/33366583/)
        * This should be able to use any CNC I/O module. Use an 11mm standoff or a 3D printed support in the mounting hole provided.
        * These Modules can be just about anything you need, pendant, more inputs, outputs, relays, spindle, VFD, Servo, OLED...

    + 1x MicroSD card slot
        * larger than 2gb needed
        * Fat32
        * 30 character or less file names, 100 character or less file location

    + Firmware
        * [FluidNC](https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC)
        * Text based config file for simple firmware edits.
        * No compiling to flash a board or change the configuration.
        * ~100% GRBL compatible
        * ESP3D-UI

### Thanks
First and foremost, thank you, Bart Dring, for the amazing design and custom firmware required to make this happen. This is based off the [6 Pack Universal CNC Controller Development Board](https://www.tindie.com/products/33366583/6-pack-universal-cnc-controller/), changes were made to accommodate all the use cases I have seen with the V1 CNC Machines except for 3D printing. 

Also, Bart Dring and Mitch Bradley many thanks for GRBL-ESP32 and now [FluidNC](https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC).

## Initial Setup

<figcaption>LR = X, Y, Z, Y2(A), Z2(B)</figcaption>
</figure>

The probe/touchplate plugs into the last port (gpio.36), on either configuration.

### Controls
If you bought your Jackpot CNC Controller from the [V1E.com](https://www.v1e.com/) store it should be ready to go. You should be able to log in directly to the WiFi SSID "FluidNC" and the password = 12345678 

![!Jackpot SSID](../img/jackpot/jackpotwifi.jpg){: loading=lazy  width="380"}

(some browsers will then need to be pointed to http://192.168.0.1, best to bookmark that address). If you get a drop down message about no internet just hit "use this network anyway".

![!WebUI](../img/jackpot/LUI.jpg){: loading=lazy width="500"}

This Interface is from the [ESP3D WebUI project](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D-WEBUI). This interface allows for wireless machine jogging, custom macros, quick buttons for any of the Jackpotâ€™s outputs, terminal control, file system control, UI and board configs, all in one place. You can update the firmware, GUI, and board settings all from the WebUI.You can wirelessly transfer your gcode files, but manually using the MicoSD card is still preferred. Most will probably never even plug the USB port in.

??? example "Control Options"
    The Jackpot Control board can use most any control software that supports GRBL such as CNC.js or Lightburn, although most people will likely use the built in WebUI's wireless connection. This can be used from most any device that has a web browser. If you are using a small touchscreen you can even zoom in so the buttons are easier to hit.

We typically use the Jackpot board in AP mode (access point), this is a direct connection betwean your web enabled device and the board itself. No internet conenction is used in this case, this is a direct connection to the Jackpot only. Touch screens work (with zoom), or keyboard and mouse will work just as well.

??? Info "Other Networking Options"
    You can also configure your device in STA mode, http://fluid.local, if you have a strong signal to your home WiFi network. This will get your board connected to your local network. This is advanced and not reccomended unless you are very confident in your networking setup. It is not reccomended to use STA mode until you are familiar with how the firmware and your machine work as it is very difficult to support and troubleshoot network issues. Please stick to AP mode until everything is stable with your workflow.

### Tests
The onboard LED's test the wiring connections. Our CNC standard is Normally Closed (NC) endstop wiring. This means you will have a lit LED when not triggered and not lit when triggered. The Probe is the opposite, lit when triggered.

You can also test the firmware by running "$Limits" in the terminal windows of the WebUI, this will show a real time trigger display. "!" to exit that mode.

### Auto Square

Auto Square on this board no longer uses Gcode commands. You can edit each endstop indivdually directly from the "Config" section of the WebUI (or directly to the yaml file).

![!CONFIG WebUI](../img/jackpot/confg.png){: loading=lazy width="400"}

From there you have a "pulloff_mm" setting for each endstop. This setting is how far the machine backs away from the endstop after it triggers it. This needs to be far enough to reset the trigger at a minimum and if your values should be within 3mm of each other. If they are not it is best to move the endstop triggers.

![!CONFIG pulloff](../img/jackpot/pulloff.png){: loading=lazy width="400"}

Be sure to **save** your edits by using the red save button on the homescreen!

### Terminal Commands
Here are some other useful terminal commands, for a full list please see the [FluidNC Wiki](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/).

`$SS` - Startup messages, if you have any info we will ask to see this output.

`$H` - Equivalent to Marlin's "Home All" or G28. $HX, $HY, $HZ for individual axes.

`$MD` - Disables the steppers, power them down.

`~` - Resume from a Pause (M0), feedhold, or safety trigger. Can be a input button, "cycle_start_pin:".

`$CD=config.yaml` - saves any config changes you make to the file. To allow it to be there after a reboot.

`$S` - This shows all the settings values.


## CAM Settings

This section is setting up estlcam for GRBL/FluidNC

![!Jackpot estlcam basics](../img/jackpot/esbasicsettings.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

Change the basic settings to GRBL.

[Config file](../img/jackpot/FluidNC.pp) for V11, to install this file open EstlCAM, setup, CNC Programs, open settings at the bottom. This will import all the settings, feedrates, rapids, starting gcode, toolchange, and ending gcode sections. Everything in one file and it is ready to use. Below are the details of this file.

Some screen shots needed here.

#### Gcode

Start, tool change, and ending gcode are all listed on the milling basics page, [here](../tools/milling-basics.md#gcode-start-tool-change-and-ending).

## Laser Tips

For the fastest raster etching, the most resource intensive thing we can do. Either use AP mode with a microSD card, or turn off the wifi and use only the USB with [Lightburn](https://lightburnsoftware.com/).

**$Wifi/Mode=off** - if you are using the USB connection to Lightburn to use some of the built-in tools it has use this command to turn off the radio. It will come back after a power cycle. 

If you have a laser defined in the config you are always in "laser" mode (M4). So you can either leave it defined and use M5 (turn off laser mode) in your starting gcode for non-laser CNC use, or just comment out the laser in the config. The Jackpot can have multiple config files stored on it. So the best way to do this is have config.yaml, and configlaser.yaml, if you want to use both. Then select the proper config and power cycle the board.

Raster speed depends on dot size, for a 0.19mm resolution I am getting 70-120mm/s depending on the type of raster.

### Laser Config.yaml Edits

Replace the following section in your yaml file. Change any settings you need to, this scales the output from 1-1000 and must match lightburn's settings.

```
user_outputs:
  analog0_pin: NO_PIN
  analog1_pin: NO_PIN
  analog2_pin: NO_PIN
  analog3_pin: NO_PIN
  analog0_hz: 5000
  analog1_hz: 5000
  analog2_hz: 5000
  analog3_hz: 5000
  digital0_pin: gpio.26
  digital1_pin: NO_PIN
  digital2_pin: NO_PIN
  digital3_pin: NO_PIN

Laser:
  pwm_hz: 5000
  output_pin: gpio.27
  enable_pin: NO_PIN
  disable_with_s0: false
  s0_with_disable: true
  tool_num: 0
  speed_map: 0=0.000% 1000=100.000%
  off_on_alarm: true
```
Quick note, **gpio.26** can have a quick pulse when starting. If you are using a 5V pin for your laser pin 27 is the better option for your enable pin.

## Firmware
If you bought it from the V1E.com store it should be ready to go. This section is in case you want to update or start fresh.

V1 Engineering Specific files - Keep an eye on this page or you can even subscribe to updates to know anytime the configuration files have changed, [Config and macros are here](https://github.com/V1EngineeringInc/FluidNC_Configs). You need to download these to load them after flashing.

FluidNC Firmware - **The Current tested and confimed FluidNC version is 3.7.16**, use anything newer than this with caution. 

### Updating / Installing Firmware

1- **Preferred method - Browser Based** - There is a [browser based tool by Joacim](https://breiler.github.io/fluid-installer/) (uses the Chrome browser). From here you need to connect your esp32 to your computer via USB. Select connect, and follow the prompts. It is best to always start fresh by using the erase option.

Some PC's will need USB drivers if your ESP is not recognized by the computer. If needed the ESP32 USB drivers are here [CP2012 drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads).

After you have loaded the firmware you can use the file browser to load our configs and macros from here, [Config and macros are here](https://github.com/V1EngineeringInc/FluidNC_Configs).

??? example "More installing and update options"
    2- **OTA** - you can update the UI or the firmware in the interface itself. [FluidNC Wiki - Update](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/installation#upgrading-firmware)
   
    3- **Manually** -
    [Firmware files are here](https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC/releases) , [Config and macros are here](https://github.com/V1EngineeringInc/FluidNC_Configs)
   
    Detailed instructions [FluidNC WIKI Install](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/installation#using-pre-compiled-files)

    Some ESP32 boards require you to hold the boot button to start flashing them, then you can release it when it starts. This is the button closest to pin D0. 
   
    When you download the files you can unzip the folder and run erase.bat (unless you are purposely updating only one part), install-wifi.bat, then install-fs.bat. Run FluidTerm from that same folder and hit ctrl+u to select the config.yaml for your machine (linked above), hit enter to accept the name.    After that is done uploading, you can hit ctrl+r to reset. The Fluid term is a crazy good tool If you ever have any issues, this is how we will check it. When you are all wired and powered up, I suggest using it to reset the board and check to see everything is working.
   
    You can also load the preferences.json, and macrocfg.json files using CTRL+U. After you log in you can more quickly load the "macro**.g" files
   
    4- **Compile from source** - You can also download the source files and compile and flash it directly from something like platform.io.


### Input / Output / Module notes

- **gpio.26** can have a quick pulse when starting. If you are using a 5V pin for your laser **gpio.27** is the better option for your enable pin.

- If you use an expansion module that needs UART you will need to add;

```markdown
uart2:
  txd_pin: gpio.14
  rxd_pin: gpio.15
  rts_pin: gpio.13
  baud: 9600
  mode: 8N1
```

## FluidNC Details

The [FluidNC Wiki](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/) has all the details of this firmware, with an excellent search bar. If you still get stuck you can of course turn to the [V1E.com forum](https://forum.v1e.com/) or there are links to a FluidNC specific discord in the wiki.

## Jackpot Cases

[Printables collection link](https://www.printables.com/@V1Engineering/collections/815309).

If you have a case that is not part of this collection please let me know and I will add it.


## Troubleshooting
Some issues we have seen.

-No USB connection - Charge only USB cable? make sure yours is data capable.

-Flashing issues - Remove the ESP32 from the Jackpot and try the web based installer again.

-No memory card showing up - Try a [class 6 card](https://amzn.to/3t4lVgF), or slower formatted in fat32. New fancy high speed cards are hit or miss. [A1 rated cards](https://amzn.to/3PRpYpx) seem particularly troublesome.

-Some PC's will need USB drivers, if needed the ESP32 USB drivers are here [CP2012 drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads).

-If you use STA mode and lose your Jackpot on the network you can find it's IP on your router, reboot with the antenna covered for 2 minutes with metal so it boots into AP mode, or just reflash.

-If you made any changes to the config use the web based tool, or fluid term, to watch the boot messages. You can also view them by typing $SS. If you do not understand it cut and paste the first half into the V1 forums.
