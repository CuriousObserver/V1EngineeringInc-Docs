# MP3DP v5 CoreXY

This is a CoreXY with easily machinable plates for ultimate rigidity where it counts but 3D printed parts where it does not matter to save from complicated multi-sided milling.

Belted Z axis, with free floating bed to allow for physical tilt correction as well as mesh correction, and possible non-planer printer in the future. Electronic brakes provide easy drop protection for the bed.
